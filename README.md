# German Traffic Signs Classification
Task 6 @Elevvo ML Internship

## Instructions
1. Dataset (Recommended): GTSRB (Kaggle).
2. Classify traffic signs based on their image using deep learning.
3. Preprocess images (resizing, normalization).
4. Train a CNN model to recognize different traffic sign classes.
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Bonus:
1. Add data augmentation to improve performance.
2. Compare custom CNN vs. pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet).
